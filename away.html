<div class="away">
	And one morning while in the woods I stumbled
</div> 
<div class="away">
    suddenly upon the thing,
</div>
<div class="away">
Stumbled upon it in a grassy clearing guarded by scaly 
</div>
<div class="away">
    oaks and elms 
</div>
<div class="away">
And the sooty details of the scene rose, thrusting 
</div>
<div class="away">
    themselves between the world and me....
</div>
</p>
<p class="away">
<div class="away">
There was a design of white bones slumbering forgottenly 
</div>
<div class="away">
    upon a cushion of ashes. 
</div>
<div class="away">
There was a charred stump of a sapling pointing a blunt 
</div>
<div class="away">
    finger accusingly at the sky. 
</div>
<div class="away">
There were torn tree limbs, tiny veins of burnt leaves, and 
</div>
<div class="away">
    a scorched coil of greasy hemp; 
</div>
<div class="away">
A vacant shoe, an empty tie, a ripped shirt, a lonely hat, 
</div>
<div class="away">
    and a pair of trousers stiff with black blood. 
</div>
<div class="away">
And upon the trampled grass were buttons, dead matches, 
</div>
<div class="away">
    butt-ends of cigars and cigarettes, peanut shells, a 
    drained gin-flask, and a whore's lipstick;
</div> 
<div class="away">
Scattered traces of tar, restless arrays of feathers, and the 
    lingering smell of gasoline. 
 </div>
 <div class="away">
And through the morning air the sun poured yellow 
    surprise into the eye sockets of the stony skull....
</div>
</p>
<p class="away">
<div class="away">
And while I stood my mind was frozen within cold pity 
</div>
<div class="away">
    for the life that was gone. 
</div>
<div class="away">
The ground gripped my feet and my heart was circled by 
</div>
<div class="away">
    icy walls of fear-- 
</div>
<div class="away">
The sun died in the sky; a night wind muttered in the 
    grass and fumbled the leaves in the trees; the woods 
    poured forth the hungry yelping of hounds; the 
    darkness screamed with thirsty voices; and the witnesses rose and lived: 
</div>
<div class="away">
The dry bones stirred, rattled, lifted, melting themselves 
    into my bones. 
</div>
<div class="away">
The grey ashes formed flesh firm and black, entering into 
    my flesh.
 </div>
 </p>
 <p class="away">
 <div class="away">
The gin-flask passed from mouth to mouth, cigars and 
    cigarettes glowed, the whore smeared lipstick red 
    upon her lips, 
</div>
<div class="away">
And a thousand faces swirled around me, clamoring that 
    my life be burned....
</div>
</p>
<p class="away">
<div class="away">
And then they had me, stripped me, battering my teeth 
    into my throat till I swallowed my own blood. 
<div class="away">
My voice was drowned in the roar of their voices, and my 
</div>
<div class="away">
    black wet body slipped and rolled in their hands as 
    they bound me to the sapling. 
</div>
<div class="away">
And my skin clung to the bubbling hot tar, falling from 
</div>
<div class="away">
    me in limp patches. 
And the down and quills of the white feathers sank into 
    my raw flesh, and I moaned in my agony.
</div> 
Then my blood was cooled mercifully, cooled by a 
    baptism of gasoline. 
<div class="away">
And in a blaze of red I leaped to the sky as pain rose like water, boiling my limbs 
</div>
<div class="away">
Panting, begging I clutched childlike, clutched to the hot 
    sides of death. 
</div>
<div class="away">
Now I am dry bones and my face a stony skull staring in 
</div>
<div class="away">
    yellow surprise at the sun....
